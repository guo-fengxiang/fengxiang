    Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urban heat island (UHI) is among the most pronounced human impacts on Earth. To formulate locally adapted mitigation strategies, a comprehensive understanding of the influencing mechanisms of UHI at high resolution is imperative. Based on surface energy balance, we attributed surface UHI (SUHI) into five biophysical terms (solar radiation, anthropogenic heat, convection, evapotranspiration and heat storage) using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in Beijing. The simulated SUHI intensity, derived by combining all five contribution terms, exhibited a good consistency but a higher spatial resolution, than SUHI intensity extracted from Landsat-8 land surface temperature product. SUHI intensity tended to decrease from the old city to outsides, attributed to the decrease of evapotranspiration, solar radiation and anthropogenic heat term. The convection and heat storage term play a positive role in reducing SUHI. Among urban morphological blocks, low-rise and high-density blocks had the strongest SUHI (2K), with the evapotranspiration term contributing the most (1.13K). The results highlighted the capacity of the urban surface to evaporate water in affecting Beijing SUHI. The proposed method provides one useful tool to analyze the drivers of SUHI from the aspect of heat formation, which can be potentially applied worldwide for large-scale comparisons of how urbanization affects UHI. </p></div>

<p style="margin:0"> <b> Characterization of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban thermal landscape<br></b>  Major revision, <i> Ecological Indicators</i> (updated Mar 12, 2024) <br><button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urbanization has affected land surface temperature (LST) significantly. Spatial average of LST is widely applied to evaluate urban heat island (UHI), but simple comparison of mean temperature is insufficient to evaluate the heterogeneity of LST and the effectiveness of urban heat mitigation strategies. This study took spatial distribution of LST as thermal landscape, and firstly employed 3D landscape metrics to analyze its spatial heterogeneity. For better comparison with UHI, the urban-rural differences of landscape metrics were defined as thermal metric island (TMI). Significant UHI and TMI were revealed by temperature amplitude, aggregation and complexity parameters, indicating higher temperature fluctuation and fragmentation in urban region. Before 2007, the standard deviation of thermal surface, landscape fragmentation and shape irregularity increased significantly, particularly in the suburbs. Later, benefited from Summer Olympic Games, the temperature fluctuation, fragmentation and shape complexity decreased obviously, and UHI intensity hit the lowest. After 2010, the intensity of UHIs and TMIs both increased. For the metrics, even mean temperature increased, the maximum temperature, landscape fragmentation and shape complexity keep decreasing in most districts. We conclude that urban temperature increases with a higher speed than suburbs, but the latter is witnessing a larger change of thermal landscape composition and configuration. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urban green spaces (UGS) have emerged as a main nature-based solution proven to effectively cool urban areas, and cooling efficiency (CE) serves as a prominent indicator for assessing the performance of UGS. Yet diurnal CE dynamics and the impact of 3D urban morphology remain underexplored. In this study, we employed diurnal land surface temperature (LST) data from Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) to delve into the diurnal dynamics of the CE of UGS within the urban core area of Paris, France. Meanwhile, using highresolution land cover data, digital height model, and explainable machine learning models, we elucidated the intricate relationship between various urban morphology metrics and CE during a 24- hour cycle. In summary, city-scale continuous monitoring revealed diurnal CE variations, with values ranging from 0.008 ℃ to 0.13 ℃ and a standard deviation of 0.04 ℃. On an average of a day, the relative importance of the 2D and 3D urban form indicators was 77.25% and 22.75%, respectively. Enhancing the dispersion of trees or improving the integrity of non-tree vegetation patches proves to be an effective strategy for augmenting CE. The results can be further used in urban planning to improve urban thermal resilience and adaptability.</p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> The necessity of combining multi-source remote sensing sensors for multi-temporal observation of the Earth, arises from the influence of cloud cover and the limited operational period of single satellite. However, significant differences exist among satellites and among sensors within the same satellite system. In this case, conducting a cross-comparison analysis is crucial for reliable change detection. The Jilin-1 satellite constellation has a total of 108 satellites in orbit, forming the largest commercial remote sensing satellites constellation in China. Firstly, the top of atmosphere (TOA) data from the Jilin-1GF03B series satellites (Jilin-1GF03B04, Jilin-1GF03B05, and Jilin-1GF03B06), following radiometric calibration processing, were selected to evaluate their performance in a single phase by comparison to Sentinel-2 satellites. Subsequently, we compared four spectrum bands and four commonly used biophysical indices, and the results indicated a higher radiation consistency between Jilin-1GF03B and Sentinel-2 satellites, suggested by correlation coefficient (over 0.953), and R2 (over 0.907). Moreover, we assessed the band sensitivity of the two satellites across different land use classes. It was found that Sentinel-2 exhibited greater sensitivity in bare land, vegetation, and forest, whereas the near-infrared band of Jilin-1GF03B proved more sensitive in water areas. Finally, to mitigate the risk of randomness in a single temporal phase, we constructed two long-term vegetation index datasets for phenological analysis. The close performance alignment observed for both single-phase and phenological variations indicated that Jilin-1GF03B satellites and Sentinel-2 can be effectively utilized together for long-term monitoring of Earth surface attributes.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As cities grow and develop, more natural landscapes are transformed into heat-absorbing surfaces, further exacerbating urban heat island (UHI) effect. To seek efficient strategies for UHI mitigation, it requires a good knowledge on the driving mechanisms of heat. Based on surface energy balance, this study decomposed surface UHI (SUHI) in terms of five biophysical drivers (radiation, anthropogenic heat, convection, evapotranspiration and heat storage), and applied the approach in Beijing using remote sensing images on Google Earth Engine. The SUHI intensity, calculated by combining the contribution terms, and the observed SUHI through Landsat 8 land surface temperature product, are in good agreement, with the root-mean square error 0.776 K and the coefficient of determination 0.947. Besides building morphological blocks, it’s the changes of the evapotranspiration term (a function to Bowen ratio, which describes the capacity of urban and rural surface to evaporate water), that controls the spatial variations of SUHI intensity during summer. For instance, in low-rise and high-density regions which exhibit a strong SUHI effect, the above five contribution terms were 0.03 K, 0.44 K, -0.74 K, 1.35 K, and -0.08 K on average, respectively. In comparison to building height, building density stronger affects the SUHI contribution terms. Based on the results, strategies of reducing the Bowen ratio, such as green spaces, cool roofs, and open building layouts, are recommended. The findings and suggestions refer to a particular city and season. Further experiments and research should be carried out for a deeper understanding of the driving mechanism of SUHI. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urban morphology varies within and among cities. Previous literature well discussed how 2D/3D morphology affects land surface temperature (LST) from physical form, scale and time. However, they focused on ranking the contributions. How quantifying the heating/cooling efficiency and conducting multi-cities comparisons is challenging. This study proposed a new framework to process this issue by integrating cities, scales, and seasons. Among 24 cities close to China's Eastern Seaboard, building coverage ratio (BCR), building height (BH), surface developed ratio (SDR), and tree height (TH) were dominant contributors to LST over seasons. Among them, TH had the highest cooling efficiency, although it varied from cities. For every 1 m increase, LST decreased about 0.3 °C in northern cities during summer and tiny during winter, while LST decreased about 0.2°C in southern cities during both summer and winter. Economic activities significantly affected the heating/cooling efficiency of dominant building features. High economic levels and population aggregation cause a significant increase in the heating effect of BCR, but a decrease in the cooling effect of BH and SDR, which collectively leads to a warmer environment. According to the results, this study offered several recommendations for better local adaptation strategies of urban transformation, with a focus on heat management. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urbanization has caused significant changes in urban morphology in three-dimensional (3D) space. Although previous studies found a close association between 2D/3D urban morphology and land surface temperature (LST), the conclusions are various and the reasons lie in three fundamental components of urban morphology: physical form, resolution and time. Beijing's old city includes massive vernacular and modern architecture, which provides an ideal laboratory for the studies. In a new approach, 3D landscape metrics were applied to analyze built forms from the aspect of composition and configuration, and to explain their contributions to LSTs together with tree height data across scales and seasons. Tree height contributed most during summer. Compared to composition, configuration metrics were less efficient for cross-scale LST changes. The relative importance of building features is scale-dependent. At small scales (under 105 m), 3D composition features contributed more to LST, while 2D composition features were dominant at larger scales (over 180 m). At intermediate scales, 2D and 3D composition metrics together affect the LSTs. The scale and seasonal dependencies indicated in this study are derived from the application of our concept to a particular city. More experiments to other cities should be carried out for an in-depth understanding of the associations. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Building height is a crucial variable in the study of urban environments, regional climates, and human-environment interactions. However, high-resolution data on building height, especially at the national scale, are limited. Fortunately, high spatial-temporal resolution earth observations, harnessed using a cloud-based platform, offer an opportunity to fill this gap. We describe an approach to estimate 2020 building height for China at 10 m spatial resolution based on all-weather earth observations (radar, optical, and night light images) using the Random Forest (RF) model. Results show that our building height simulation has a strong correlation with real observations at the national scale (RMSE of 6.1 m, MAE = 5.2 m, R = 0.77). The Combinational Shadow Index (CSI) is the most important contributor (15.1%) to building height simulation. Analysis of the distribution of building morphology reveals significant differences in building volume and average building height at the city scale across China. Macau has the tallest buildings (22.3 m) among Chinese cities, while Shanghai has the largest building volume (298.4 108 m3). The strong correlation between modelled building volume and socio-economic parameters indicates the potential application of building height products. The building height map developed in this study with a resolution of 10 m is open access, provides insights into the 3D morphological characteristics of cities and serves as an important contribution to future urban studies in China. </p></div>

    Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urban morphology refers to the physical form of a city that is constantly transformed and updated in the process of urbanization. A valuable source of data on ‘built forms’ is modern remote sensing technology, which provides a variety of products on building footprints and heights at national, continental, and global levels. A large-scale comparison of urban morphologies is important for assessing urban development as well as its influence on urban ecology; however, this has not been well documented so far. This study includes 41 cities in China and 36 in Europe with various city sizes, population densities, and climate features. We applied 3D landscape metrics and principal component analysis (PCA) to compare the spatial aspects of the urban morphology of these cities. We found: (1) measurements of the building height, surface fluctuation, and texture directionality of urban building layouts in China are higher than those of European cities, while the latter are high-density and compact built landscapes; (2) a significant clustering phenomenon for Chinese and European cities revealed by PCA, with the former showing a much more aggregated pattern, indicating a relatively uniform morphology of urban buildings in China; (3) distinctions between cities in China and Europe are suggested by the first principal component, to which building height, surface fluctuation, building complexity, and spatial distance among buildings contribute significantly; and (4) the second principal component (mainly represented by maximum building height, surface area, volume, and shape metrics) can separate large metropolitan cities and provincial capitals from cities with lower urban population, smaller size, and slower economic development. Our results demonstrate the potential of 3D landscape metrics for measuring urban morphology. Together with a temporal analysis, these metrics are useful for quantifying how urban morphology varies in space and time on a large scale, as well as evaluating the process of urbanization.  </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Land surface temperature (LST), retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) bands of remote sensing satellites, is an important parameter for various climate and environmental models. TIR bands detect a range of low-energy wavelengths, resulting in a coarser spatial resolution than other multispectral bands, and limiting applicability in heterogeneous urban regions. In this study, a new nonlinear method for LST downscaling, called Three Layers Composition (TLC), was proposed. The TLC integrates large-scale temperature variations, re-constructed detailed characteristics of LSTs, and strong boundary information. The performance of TLC is compared with disaggregation of radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad), thermal imagery sharpening (TsHARP), and random forest (RF) for a complex landscape in Beijing city, which has agriculture, forest, and massive impervious surfaces. The scale effects on the downscaled LSTs (DLST) were analyzed from the aspects of spatial resolution and spatial contexts. The experimental results indicate that the nonlinear algorithms (TLC and RF) perform better than linear methods (DisTrad and TsHARP). Indicated by coefficient of determination (R2), centered root-mean-square error (CRMSE), and correlation coefficient (CC), TLC (R2 = 0.901, CRMSE = 0.319, CC = 0.951) was the most effective and workable technique for predicting LSTs, followed by RF (0.768, 0.502, 0.874), TsHARP (0.544, 0.652, 0.734), and DisTrad (0.518, 0.751, 0.719). Larger experimental regions and larger ratios between initial and target resolution weaken the accuracy of DLST. TLC indicated a stronger ability to resist the influence of such scale effects. Traditional downscaling methods (DisTrad, TsHARP, and RF) are trained with global LST-predictor relationships and predict the DLST point by point, which can result in significantly biased estimates for very high or very low temperatures. Addressing this issue, TLC advantageously preserves the texture similarity between LST and its predictors, and yields more precise DLST, which showed higher consistency with the reference LST. Considering high accuracy and low computation time, TLC may be a safe technique for LST downscaling in other regions and different remote sensing sensors.  </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Globally, rapid urbanization accompanied by a great deal of anthropogenic heat emission, further led to severe urban heat island (UHI) effects, posing a significant risk to human and environmental health. Understanding the combined driving effects of intra-urban temperature variation is vital to UHI mitigation. Although previous studies have extensively revealed the essential contribution of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) architectural morphology to the land surface temperature (LST), their combined effects and seasonality on shaping the LST is still inconclusive, especially at finer scales. Therefore, this study aimed at broadening insight for thermal environment optimization from a block perspective. For the first time, the urban morphological blocks (UMBs) were introduced as the basic units to characterize the spatial-temporal variability of LST under various architectural morphological conditions. Multifactorial LST drivers, comprising architectural morphology, land cover, land use, and functions, were rigorously examined by the geographical detector model. The results showed that the highest LST generally occurred in the UMBs with the lowest building height and highest building density. The contribution of building aggregation to hot spots was most significant in the low-rise UMBs, while the cooling effects of the shadows were more pronounced in middle-density and high-density UMBs. In terms of different seasons, architectural morphological characteristics significantly contributed to LST variations under cold temperature, and the factors characterizing impervious surface and greening were always the two most powerful drivers in warm seasons. More factors contributed to the spatial patterns of LST variation in winter, suggesting a more complex LST driving mechanism under lower temperatures. Hierarchically, architectural morphologies, surface biophysical parameters, and urban land cover largely affected LST; however, the functional property factors were comparatively weak driving forces. The interaction detector model identified bilinear-enhanced and nonlinear-enhanced interactions from pairs of factors affecting LST over different seasons.  </p></div>

Significant multi-scale correlation exists between the land surface temperature (LST) and landscape pattern. Compared with traditional linear regression methods, the regression model based on random forest has the advantages of higher accuracy and better learning ability, and can remove the linear correlation between regression features. Taking Beijing’s metropolitan area as an example, this paper conducted multi-scale relationship analysis between 3D landscape patterns and LST using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results indicated that LST was relatively high in the central area of Beijing, and decreased from the center to the surrounding areas. The interpretation effect of 3D landscape metrics on LST was more obvious than that of the 2D landscape metrics, and 3D landscape diversity and evenness played more important roles than the other metrics in the change of LST. The multi-scale relationship between LST and the landscape pattern was discovered in the fourth ring road of Beijing, the effect of the extent of change on the landscape pattern is greater than that of the grain size change, and the interpretation effect and correlation of landscape metrics on LST increase with the increase in the rectangle size. Impervious surfaces significantly increased the LST, while the impervious surfaces located at low building areas were more likely to increase LST than those located at tall building areas. It seems that increasing the distance between buildings to improve the rate of energy exchange between urban and rural areas can effectively decrease LST. Vegetation and water can effectively reduce LST, but large, clustered and irregularly shaped patches have a better effect on land surface cooling than small and discrete patches. The Coefficients of Rectangle Variation (CORV) power function fitting results of landscape metrics showed that the optimal rectangle size for studying the relationship between the 3D landscape pattern and LST is about 700 m. Our study is useful for future urban planning and provides references to mitigate the daytime urban heat island (UHI) effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Urbanization has produced extremely diverse structures of buildings, including horizontal sprawl, vertical growth, and a transition from traditional to modern architecture. Although the influence of urban morphology on urban heat formation is unquestioned, previous research has relied just on the 2D building composition and its influence on diurnal land surface temperatures (DLSTs). However, it is not well known that the 3D building configuration affects nocturnal land surface temperatures (NLSTs) and seasonal variations. In a new approach, a set of 3D landscape metrics, based on both aspects of composition and configuration, is here proposed and tested for spatiotemporal associations to land surface temperatures (LSTs) in Beijing's old city. The combination of classical and modern architecture styles makes this region an ideal laboratory for LST studies in highly different urban structures. Major findings include: 1) 3D landscape metrics effectively and suitably describe the diversity, irregularity and spatial arrangement of buildings; 2) Denser and more compact building patterns result in higher DLSTs, whereas highest NLSTs occur around modern high-rise buildings; 3) 3D landscape metrics have sensitive correlations to DLSTs, but in general NLSTs are closer associated with composition metrics rather than configuration metrics; 4) Both DLST and NLST are most importantly affected by building numbers and nearest distances between buildings; 5) The association between urban morphology and LSTs is fairly stable over all four seasons; with the variation that the summer relationship was relatively lower due to stronger solar radiation and evapotranspiration of urban vegetation.  </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Scale dependence is one of the major characteristics of landscape. Urban landscape is highly affected by human activities with a multi-scale structure, which makes the multi-scale identification of urban structure an obligation for urban spatial studies. Although there have been many previous studies on urban landscape structure, most of them have been conducted on a single scale, and the multi-scale effects of landscape patterns were rarely involved. Two-dimensional wavelet transforms can link spatial structures to scale and spatial locations, and maybe an effective method for the multi-scale analysis of landscape. In this paper, we applied two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform and wavelet variance to analyze the multi-scale spatial structure characteristics and the nested hierarchical structure of the metropolitan Beijing area. The results indicated that the spatial distribution and configuration of the patches were highly scattered at small scales, and the urban landscape exhibited a relatively complicated structure. At medium scales, a combination of the polycentric and sectorial structure was identified due to the prominence of dominant patches within each administrative district. At larger scales, the urban landscape pattern exhibits typical concentric ring characteristics. Two characteristic scales were detected by the wavelet variance in the south-north direction of the main urban zones, scale 4 (112m) and 8 (1792m) in Dongcheng District, scale 3 (56m) and 6 (448m) in Xicheng District, which were corresponding to the extent of middle-small blocks and large blocks respectively. One characteristic scale was detected in each of the suburb areas (Chaoyang, Haidian, and Fengtai District). The spatial structure of the main urban zones is more complex than that of the suburb areas, and it presents a typical hierarchical structure in the south-north direction. In general, the spatial structure of Beijing metropolitan area appears polycentric and concentric ring structure at large scales, the main urban area has nested hierarchies at different characteristic scales, and the wavelet method can effectively identify multi-scale characteristics of urban spatial structure.  </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> The relationship between urban landscape pattern and land surface temperature (LST) is one of the core issues in urban thermal environment research. Although previous studies have shown a significant correlation between LST and landscape pattern, most were conducted at a single scale and rarely involve multi-scale effects of the landscape pattern. Wavelet coherence can relate the correlation between LST and landscape pattern to spatial scale and location, which is an effective multi-scale correlation method. In this paper, we applied wavelet coherence and Pearson correlation coefficient to analyze the multi-scale correlations between landscape pattern and LST, and analyzed the spatial pattern of the urban thermal environment during the urbanization of Beijing from 2004 to 2017 by distribution index of high-temperature center (HTC). The results indicated that the HTC of Beijing gradually expands from the main urban zone and urban function extended zone to the new urban development zone and far suburb zone, and develops from monocentric to polycentric spatial pattern. Land cover types, such as impervious surfaces and bare land, have a positive contribution to LST, while water and vegetation play a role in mitigating LST. The wavelet coherence and Pearson correlation coefficients showed that landscape composition and spatial configuration have significant effects on LST, but landscape composition has a greater effect on LST in Beijing metropolitan area. Landscape composition indexes (NDBI and NDVI) showed significant multi-scale characteristics with LST, especially at larger scales, which has a strong correlation on the whole transect. There was no significant correlation between the spatial configuration indexes (CONTAG, DIVISION, and LSI) and LST at smaller scales, only at larger scales near the urban area has a significant correlation. With the increase of the scale, Pearson correlation coefficient calculated by spatial rectangle sampling and wavelet coherence coefficient have the same trend, although it had some fluctuations in several locations. However, the wavelet coherence coefficient diagram was smoother and less affected by position and rectangle size, which more conducive to describe the correlation between landscape pattern index and LST at different scales and locations. In general, wavelet coherence provides a multi-scale method to analyze the relationship between landscape pattern and LST, helping to understand urban planning and land management to mitigate the factors affecting urban thermal environment.  </p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Landscapes display overlapping sets of correlations in different regions at different spatial scales, and these correlations can be delineated by pattern analysis. This study identified the correlations between landscape pattern and topography at various scales and locations in urban-rural profiles from Jilin City, China, using Pearson correlation analysis and wavelet method. Two profiles, 30 km (A) and 35 km (B) in length with 0.1-km sampling intervals, were selected. The results indicated that profile A was more sensitive to the characterization of the land use pattern as influenced by topography due to its more varied terrain, and three scales (small, medium, and large) could be defined based on the variation in the standard deviation of the wavelet coherency in profile A. Correlations between landscape metrics and elevation were similar at large scales (over 8 km), while complex correlations were discovered at other scale intervals. The medium scale of cohesion and Shannon’s diversity index was 1–8 km, while those of perimeter-area fractal dimension and edge density index were 1.5–8 km and 2–8 km, respectively. At small scales, the correlations were weak as a whole and scattered due to the micro-topography and landform elements, such as valleys and hillsides. At medium scales, the correlations were most affected by local topography, and the land use pattern was significantly correlated with topography at several locations. At large spatial scales, significant correlation existed throughout the study area due to alternating mountains and plains. In general, the strength of correlation between landscape metrics and topography increased gradually with increasing spatial scale, although this tendency had some fluctuations in several locations. Despite a complex calculating process and ecological interpretation, the wavelet method is still an effective tool to identify multi-scale characteristics in landscape ecology.  </p></div>

    Abstract

<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> General landscape metrics are mainly conducted in two dimensional space, while the terrain undulation is usually not considered. Terrain fluctuation affects a landscape’s spatial heterogeneity and its spatial-temporal dynamics by diversifying the spatial distribution of soil, vegetation and animals. This article proposed three methods to measure the landscape pattern in three dimensional space, including the 3D derivation of 2D landscape metrics, 3D surface roughness parameters, 3D power spectral analysis and 3D correlation analysis. 3D surface data were designed and validated using the proposed 3D landscape pattern analyzing metrics, and the results indicated that these measurements can effectively evaluate the 3D composition, spatial configuration and texture direction of 3D landscape.
